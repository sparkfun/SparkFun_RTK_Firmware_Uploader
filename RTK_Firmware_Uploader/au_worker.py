# Written/Update by  SparkFun Electronics, Fall 2022
#
# This python package implements a GUI Qt application that supports
# firmware and bootloader uploading to the SparkFun Artemis module
#
# This file is part of the job dispatch system, which runs "jobs"
# in a background thread for the artemis_uploader package/application.
#
# This file implements the main logic of the background worker system.
#
# In general, the worker implements a background thread which waits for
# "jobs" to be passed in for execution via a queue object. Once a job is
# detected, it is sent to the target "action" object for execution.
#
# During job execution, messages are relayed to the main application
# via a passed in callback function.
#
# When a job is executed, it is assumed that "command line" python
# scripts are used for the underlying logic. As such stdout and stderr are
# captured for output. Also, "exit()" calls are trapped, so  the thread
# will continue to execute.
#
# More information on qwiic is at https://www.sparkfun.com/artemis
